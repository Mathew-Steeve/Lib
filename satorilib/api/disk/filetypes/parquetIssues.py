'''
notice when we had the parquet situation we had to do stuff like this which 
should have been done in the disk module, but was instead done at higher levels:
'''
# def getHistoryOf(self, streamId: StreamId):

#     def tellModelsAboutNewHistory():
#         tellEm = False
#         for model in self.start.engine.models:
#             if model.variable == streamId:
#                 tellEm = True
#             else:
#                 for target in model.targets:
#                     if target == streamId:
#                         tellEm = True
#         if tellEm:
#             model.inputsUpdated.on_next(True)

#     def gatherUnknownHistory() -> list[PeerMessage]:

#         def lookThoughIncrementals(timestamp: str, value: str):
#             ''' gets a df of the incrementals and looks for the observation'''
#             df = diskApi.read(aggregate=False)
#             if timestamp in df.index:

#             return False

#             ''' sees if the timestamp exists in the aggregate '''
#             # only checks to see if the timestamp exists, not the value
#             # if we want to check the value to we have to read in the full file
#             return diskApi.timeExistsInAggregate(timestamp)

#         msg: PeerMessage = topic.getOneObservation(time=now())
#         incrementalsChecked = False

#         while msg is not None and not msg.isNoneResponse():
#             # here we have a situation. we should tell the data manager about
#             # this and let it handle it. but this stream isnt' the best way to
#             # do that because it is built for only new realtime data in mind:
#             # start.engine.data.newData.on_next(
#             #    ObservationFromPeerMessage.fromPeerMessage(msg))
#             # well. we have history datapoints that we may or may not already
#             # have, furthermore, if we do already have it, we should probably
#             # top asking... so what do we do here? technically all ipfs sync
#             # is save the entire ipfs history to disk using:
#             # diskApi.path(aggregate=None, temp=True)
#             # then combines it with what is currently known, on disk, using:
#             # diskApi.compress(includeTemp=True)
#             # but we don't want to do that because we dont' want to download the
#             # entire history. we want to stop once we start seeing data we
#             # already have. so we really need 2-way communication with the data
#             # manager of the engine... so we need to listen to a stream on which
#             # it can respond. which is pretty nasty. so we'll think about it...
#             # ok, I think I know what to do. we don't ask or notify the data
#             # manager at all. instead we look at the data, one row at a time
#             # until we find this observation or don't. if we don't find it, we
#             # we know we can stop asking, if we don't find it, we save it as an
#             # incremental, and loop until we reach the end or find one we have.
#             # then we combine the incrementals with the aggregate and compress
#             # and if we have to do that, we tell the models to update. done.
#             # we'll have to look through the incrementals first, then the
#             # aggregates. and keep a flag if we get into aggregates, so we don't
#             # hit incrementals each time we loop.
